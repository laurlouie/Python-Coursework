# This will return a numeric type of answer at the end of the code that could be classified as a float type since there is a decimal point in the answer.
58.5

    print("You cannot divide a number by 0")

# A code like this one can be useful to someone because it will allow you to see if what you try fails, the except part can choose to do something different.
You cannot divide a number by 0
